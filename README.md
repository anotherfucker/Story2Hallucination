# Story2Hallucination with skimage.metrics import structural_similarity as ssim and compare_ssim tweak

This is a Colab notebook used to render paragraphs and whole stories of text as animations using [Big Sleep](https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep/).  The animations from the stories look wild, hence, Story2Hallucination.

The [main notebook](https://github.com/lots-of-things/Story2Hallucination/blob/main/Story2Hallucination.ipynb) runs on Colab and generates raw images and saves them to drive so you can download and create longer videos.  There is also a [GIF making notebook](https://github.com/lots-of-things/Story2Hallucination/blob/main/Story2Hallucination_GIF.ipynb) that will make a GIF on colab that you can display or download directly without connecting to Drive (but note that large gifs won't play on colab and will take a long time to download).


You can easily open the notebook in Google Colab here.

To render the story audio you can use Google's TTS API. More info [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-text-speech-python3)
